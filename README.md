# Project Overview: Virtual Assistant -  Using OpenAI API and Java Swing
<br>
The project is for first-year Java assignment that serves as a virtual assistant . It leverages the OpenAI API for natural language processing and understanding, providing intelligent responses to user queries.
The graphical user interface (GUI) for the project is developed using Java Swing, allowing users to interact with the virtual assistant through a simple and intuitive interface.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
To create a helpful tool for college students that can assist with various academic and administrative tasks.
To integrate OpenAI's advanced language model to understand and respond to user inputs.
To design a user-friendly GUI using Java Swing that facilitates easy interaction with the virtual assistant.

## Features
User Interaction: Users can type their queries into a text field and receive responses in a chat-like interface.
Natural Language Processing: The virtual assistant uses the OpenAI API to process and understand natural language queries, providing relevant and context-aware responses.
Task Assistance: The assistant can help with tasks such as finding information about college events, explaining academic concepts, setting reminders, and answering general knowledge questions.
GUI Design: The Swing-based interface includes text input fields, response display areas, and buttons for submitting queries.
Implementation Details
1. Setting Up the Project
Java Environment: The project is developed in Java using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Dependencies: The project requires the OpenAI API client library for Java, which can be included using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
2. GUI Development with Swing
Main Frame: The main application window is created using JFrame.
Input Field: A JTextField is used for users to type their queries.
Submit Button: A JButton allows users to submit their queries.
Response Area: A JTextArea displays the assistant's responses, providing a chat-like interface.
3. Integrating OpenAI API
API Key: An API key from OpenAI is required to authenticate requests.
HTTP Requests: The application sends HTTP requests to the OpenAI API with the userâ€™s query.
Response Handling: The API's response is parsed and displayed in the GUI.
